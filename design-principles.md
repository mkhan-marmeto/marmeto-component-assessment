## Design Principles

### 1. Accessibility
- All components are keyboard accessible.
- Proper semantic HTML tags are used to enhance usability for screen readers.
- WAI-ARIA attributes are implemented where necessary to communicate component states.
- High contrast is maintained between text and background for readability.

### 2. Consistency
- A unified design language is followed to ensure all components feel part of the same system.
- Common styles for typography, colors, and spacing are reused across components.
- Naming conventions for classes are clear and follow a standard format.

### 3. Reusability
- Components are modular and can be reused in different contexts without modification.
- CSS is organized to avoid conflicts and ensure components can coexist on the same page.

### 4. Responsiveness
- Components are designed to work seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.
- Media queries and relative units are used to ensure scalability.

### 5. Scalability
- The system is built to accommodate new components and variations with minimal effort.
- Class-based styling and utility-first design principles make the system extendable.

### 6. Clarity
- Components are designed with a focus on simplicity and clarity to ensure easy understanding by developers and users.
- Documentation accompanies each component, explaining its purpose and usage.

### 7. Performance
- The design avoids unnecessary DOM elements and complex styles to ensure quick rendering.
- Minimal and clean CSS is used for better load times.
